## Django/React Blog

This is a little project I decided to put together so that I can experiment with stuff in my free time and document my process. 

I created a website using Django for the backend and React for the frontend. I have experience in both but not together in the same project, so I thought it would be fun to make something where I could write a Post using the Django admin interface and render it with React.

The first few posts are to document how I created this: https://michaeldormann.dev
